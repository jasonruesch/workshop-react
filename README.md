## Jumpstart Coding Labs

The Jumpstart labs introduce - to the student(s) - a simple React application with routing between ContactList and ContactDetails views.

This workshop includes the following "hands-on" coding labs:

- Step 1 : Add types to ContactsService
- Step 2a: Create contacts Data-Access library
- Step 2b: Create a Shared-API library
- Step 3a: Create a contacts UI library
- Step 3b: Add routing to the ContactDetail view
- Step 4 : Use Functional components
- Step 5 : Use Custom Hooks
- Step 6a: Sharing services with Context API
- Step 6b: Use Dependency Injection (DI)

Each lab will encourage the student to apply lecture ideas and patterns. With hands-on coding, developers will explore the concepts of React Functional Components, hooks, custom hooks and Dependency Injection.

> Note: The solutions to the Jumpstart labs are on the `finish/jump-start` branch; each lab is organized as a distinct git-commit.

## Getting Started

- Run `npm install`
- Run `nx serve` to build the contacts application and start a dev web server.

Navigate to http://localhost:4200/.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
